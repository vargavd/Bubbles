# Bubbles
My old and funny bubbles diagram.

This project was made for learning javascript standards and practises. 

You can make bubbles on the canvas with double click, you can resize them with mouse or delete with right click.
If you select a bubble, you can see its values on the bottom bar - and you can modify them as well there.

Have fun :)
